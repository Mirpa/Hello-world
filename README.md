# Hello-world

Hello humans of GitHub!

Let me introduce myself. My name is Mireia, I'm from Catalonia and I love coffee!
Been working on the IT industry as a business analyst for around 5 years. 

I started my profile on GitHub because I felt I needed a change in my career. Currently focused on learning web development.
My repositories are public, so any kind of constructive feedback and advise is 100% welcomed and apreciated.

Thanks for reading this! :)
